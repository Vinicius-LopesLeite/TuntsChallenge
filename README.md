 Tunts Challenge

This is my PHP code for the Tunts Challenge to the Intership vacancy

This code uses PHP/Composer/GoogleSheets API


Follow the next steps to sucessfully execute the program

1- First you will need to have the PHP installed in your system, you can use the following link to install it: https://www.php.net/downloads.php

2- Second you will need the Composer - A Dependency Manager used for PHP - You can download it by their own website: https://getcomposer.org/download/

3- Third you will need to clone this repository to your own computer using this link: https://github.com/Vinicius-LopesLeite/TuntsChallenge.git

4- And for the Last Step you need to go with your terminal to the folder where you cloned the repository and execute the following command:   

composure require google/appclient:"^2.0" -W
       
       
       
After all the enviroment set its time to run the code, and for that you only need to go with your terminal to the folder where you cloned the repository, and execute the command: 
php DesafioTunts.php
 
 You will see in the terminal an echo from the execution where will show the information received from the Sheet and the output that will be going to be included in the document
 Also you can see the same echo in the log.txt file
 
 Now you can open the Google Sheet document and see the results of each student.
 
 Thank you for your time;
 Any feedback would be great.
