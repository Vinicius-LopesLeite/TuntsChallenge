# Tunts Challenge

## This is my PHP Solution for the Tunts Challenge proposed in the Intership Process  
**This solution uses PHP/Composer/GoogleSheets API**

This is the link for the GoggleSheet document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZDTIani5q4yqeKYfwSsL8_xcm3uaxoR9m-zdhekROAg/edit?usp=sharing

Follow the next steps to sucessfully execute the program

1. First you will need to have the PHP installed in your system, I strongly recommend to install by the xampp installer: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
   Or you can use the following link to install it direct from to original source: https://www.php.net/downloads.php

1. Second you will need the Composer - A Dependency Manager used for PHP - You can download it by their own website: https://getcomposer.org/download/

1. Third you will need to clone this repository to your own computer using this link: https://github.com/Vinicius-LopesLeite/TuntsChallenge.git

1. Now you need to go with your terminal to the folder where you cloned the repository and execute the following command: **composer install**

1. Check if the columns "Situação" and "Nota para Aprovação Final" are empty, this way allowing you to see the changes during the code execution

1. With the enviroment set, you can start the execution of the code, you only need to go with your terminal to the folder where you cloned the repository, and execute the command:  
- **php .\DesafioTunts.php**
 
 You will see in the terminal an echo from the execution where will show the information received from the Sheet and the output that will be going to be included in the document
 Also you can see the same echo in the log.txt file
 
 Now you can open the Google Sheet document and see the results of each student.
 
 Thank you for your time;
 Any feedback would be great.
